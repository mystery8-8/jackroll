## 3. User Authentication & Profile System

### 3.1 Wallet-Based Identity System
**Core Philosophy: Your Wallet = Your Profile**

JackRoll uses a wallet-centric identity system where connecting your wallet creates your user profile. This approach ensures:
- **Decentralized Identity**: No traditional usernames/passwords - your wallet address is your identity
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Same identity across all Web3 platforms
- **Security**: Private key ownership provides maximum security
- **Transparency**: All actions are tied to verifiable on-chain addresses

### 3.2 Authentication Rules & Requirements

**üîê Logged-In User Capabilities:**
- ‚úÖ **Full App Access**: Complete access to all features and interactions
- ‚úÖ **Chat Participation**: Can view and send messages in community chat
- ‚úÖ **Pot Interactions**: Can enter pots, place NFTs, and participate in games
- ‚úÖ **Profile & Stats**: Automatic profile creation with activity tracking
- ‚úÖ **Transaction Signing**: All blockchain interactions with wallet signatures

**üëÄ Guest User Experience (View-Only Mode):**
- ‚úÖ **Browse Interface**: Can explore the entire application interface
- ‚úÖ **View Pots**: Can see all active pots and their current states
- ‚úÖ **Read Chat**: Can view all chat messages and conversations
- ‚úÖ **Monitor Activity**: Can watch games in progress and see results

**üö´ Guest User Restrictions (Interaction Blocked):**
- ‚ùå **Chat Sending**: Cannot send messages (prompted to login when attempted)
- ‚ùå **Pot Participation**: Cannot enter pots or place NFTs (login prompt appears)
- ‚ùå **Profile Actions**: No stats tracking, favorites, or personalization
- ‚ùå **Social Features**: Cannot add friends or participate in social activities
- ‚ùå **Any Transactions**: All wallet-requiring actions trigger login prompts

### 3.2.1 User Experience Flow for Non-Authenticated Users

**Login Prompt Strategy:**
When guests attempt restricted actions, they encounter contextual prompts:

1. **Chat Message Attempt**: 
   - Input field shows "Connect wallet to send messages"
   - Click triggers wallet connection flow
   - Clear messaging: "Join the conversation by connecting your wallet"

2. **Pot Interaction Attempt**:
   - Buttons show "Connect Wallet to Play" instead of "Enter Pot"
   - Hover states explain wallet requirement
   - Modal appears: "Connect your wallet to participate in pots"

3. **Transaction Actions**:
   - All interactive elements gracefully prompt for wallet connection
   - No broken states - everything is accessible but gated
   - Seamless transition from guest to authenticated user

### 3.3 User Profile System

**Profile Components:**
- **Primary Identity**: Wallet address (abbreviated as 0x1234...5678)
- **Activity Stats**: 
  - Total pots entered
  - Win/loss ratio
  - Favorite pot types
  - Total volume traded
- **Social Features**:
  - Chat participation history
  - Friend connections (other wallet addresses)
  - Reputation score based on activity
- **NFT Portfolio**: Display connected wallet's NFT collection
- **Transaction History**: On-chain record of all pot participations

**Profile Benefits:**
- **Persistent Identity**: Profile follows you across sessions and devices
- **Trust Building**: Activity history builds reputation in community
- **Personalization**: UI adapts based on user preferences and history
- **Social Connections**: Build network of trusted trading partners

### 3.4 Security & Privacy Considerations

**Security Measures:**
- **Wallet Signature Verification**: All actions require cryptographic proof
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with wallet state
- **Transaction Validation**: Smart contract validation for all interactions
- **Privacy Options**: Users can choose visibility levels for profile data

**Best Practices:**
- **Burner Wallets Recommended**: Use dedicated wallet for gaming activities
- **Hardware Wallet Support**: Full support for Ledger, Trezor, etc.
- **Multi-Wallet Support**: Easy switching between different wallet addresses
- **Logout Protection**: Secure logout clears all session data
