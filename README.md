## 5. Pot System - Core Functionality

### 5.1 Pot Types Overview

| Feature | Degen Pot (Safe) | Jacked Pot (High Risk) |
|---------|------------------|---------------------------|
| Risk Level | Low - Always receive 1 NFT back | High - Winner takes all |
| Outcome | 1 NFT in → 1 NFT out (shuffled) | 3 NFTs in → 1 winner gets all 3 |
| Categories | Low Tier (<1 ETH), High Stakes (≥1 ETH) | Low Tier (<1 ETH), High Stakes (≥1 ETH) |

### 5.2 Degen Pot Mechanics
- **Entry**: User deposits 1 verified NFT
- **Outcome**: Guaranteed to receive 1 NFT back (yours or another participant's)
- **Fairness**: Equal probability via Gelato VRF
- **Risk**: Value variance only

### 5.3 Jacked Pot Mechanics - Redesigned for Scale

**Queue-Based System for High Demand:**
- **Entry Queue**: Users join a global queue for their preferred tier
- **Automatic Matching**: System creates pots of 3 from the queue
- **Fair Ordering**: First-come, first-served with on-chain timestamps
- **Instant Pot Creation**: As soon as 3 compatible NFTs are queued

**Entry Process:**
1. User selects NFT and joins tier-specific queue
2. Clear risk warning with typed confirmation
3. Smart contract locks NFT and records queue position
4. Real-time queue position display
5. Auto-match when 2 other compatible NFTs join

**Benefits of Queue System:**
- Handles unlimited concurrent users
- No racing for limited pots
- Fair and transparent ordering
- Reduces gas wars
- Better user experience

### 5.4 Pot Management Rules

**Degen Pots:**
- Maintain 10-15 visible pots per tier
- Auto-generate new pots as they fill
- No time limits - organic filling
- Shareable pot IDs for social engagement

**Jacked Pots:**
- Queue-based with no visible pot limit
- Show queue depth and estimated wait time
- Optional: VIP queue for high-volume users
- Leaderboard for biggest wins

### 5.5 NFT Verification & Pricing
- **Primary Sources**: OpenSea and Magic Eden APIs
- **Verification**: Blue checkmark for verified collections
- **Price Tiers**: Automatic categorization based on floor price
- **Cross-chain Support**: Ethereum, Polygon, and future chains
